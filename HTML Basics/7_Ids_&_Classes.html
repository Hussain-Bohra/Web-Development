    <h1>Ids and Classes in HTML</h1>

    <!-- Understand this from a real world situation, Suppose your manager says you have to change the background color of 5 elements You will say Seriously! it is a piece of cake i can do it easily.
    but what if the elements will be change from 5 to 100 or more would you go on a each element to put style tag
    and keep changing colors? No na, that's why ids and classes are came in the html world this makes this
    types of works much easier, I hope you get better understanding from this Keep Learning and Enjoy the Process. -->



    <!-- ids and classes used to target elements,
        while id is used to target a particular element, on
        the other hand class can be used to target multiple elements -->
    <!-- id means identifier it is always unique for each element -->
    <!-- class also used to catch the element by it's names but their is a difference
        in class and id, while id is a unique for each element on the other hands
        classes can be defined to multiple elements -->

    <!-- keynotes to remember -->
    <!-- id can assign to one element only -->
    <!-- classes can be assign to multiple elements -->

    <div id="div1" class="mydiv1">

        <p>Hello i am in a div1 tag</p>

    </div>

    <div class="mydiv1 mydiv2 mydiv3">we can give many classes to a single element</div>
